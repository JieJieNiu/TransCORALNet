# TransCORALNet
## Architecture
Code for the Paper "TransCORALNet: A Two-Stream Transformer CORAL Networks for Supply Chain Credit Assessment Cold Start" 

The paper is accepted by the jounal Expert System with Applications.

The proposed TransCORALNet can be found in the model-folder under: 

**>>>IMPORTANT<<<**

The original Code from the paper can be found in this branch:[[TransCORALNet](https://github.com/JieJieNiu/TransCORALNet/tree/main/TransCORALNet)]


Also we provide the code of baseline models MMD and Deep CORAL:[[MMD and DeepCORAL](https://github.com/JieJieNiu/TransCORALNet/tree/main/MMD%20and%20DeepCORAL)]
CADA and DANN: [[CADA and DANN](https://github.com/JieJieNiu/TransCORALNet/tree/main/CADA%20and%20DANN)]


The trained model canbe download in this branch, you can load model-TransCORALNet.pt and use it directly, also the baseline models of CADA, DANN, MMD and DeepCORAL can be download here: 
[[Download trained models]( https://github.com/JieJieNiu/TransCORALNet/tree/main/Trained%20models)]

The current master branch has since upgraded packages and was refactored. Since the exact package-versions differ the experiments may not be 100% reproducible.

If you have problems running the code, feel free to open an issue here on Github.

## Usages
### Generate synthetic data
First, use [CTGAN](https://github.com/JieJieNiu/TransCORALNet/tree/main/%20Synthetic%20target%20training%20and%20DataLoader) to generate synthetic data as target train data. Then use [dataloader] to prepare the training and testing dataset.


### Training
We offer several training/testing options as below:
For batchsize (--batchsize, default 256)
For training/testing epoch (--epoch, default 250)
TPU allocation 


example
For TransCORALNet training:
```
python TransCORALNet\train and test.py --batchsize 256 --epoch 250 --tpu
```
ForTransCORALNet prediction:
```
python TransCORALNet/prediction.py
```

### Explanation
You can use [[[Lime](https://github.com/JieJieNiu/TransCORALNet/tree/main/LIME)] to interpret the results of a model prediction. 
Also, the attention score calculation and visualization can be seen here: [Attention score](https://github.com/JieJieNiu/TransCORALNet/blob/main/TransCORALNet/Attention%20score%20results.py)


### Plot

Creating similar plots as in the paper: 
Using [rawgraphs](https://www.rawgraphs.io/) to create the following graph:

negative<img src='neg.png' width='200'> 
difference<img src='diff.png' width='200'>

Using [chiplot](https://www.chiplot.online/) to create the following LIME explanation results:

### Dataset
The dataset are not open access due to the current data protocal. If you are interested in the dataset that we used in this paper please write an e-mail to: s.mehrkanoon@uu.nl and j.shi1@uu.nl 

If you want to run this model on your own datasets, you can either

(1) reorganize your datasets: Step 1.normalized using a [Min-Max normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Rescaling_(min-max_normalization)). Step 2. run this code with your data to fit your project.
